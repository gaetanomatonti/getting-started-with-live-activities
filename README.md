# [Getting Started with Live Activities](https://gaetanomatonti.dev/posts/getting-started-with-live-activities)

This project showcases how to implement a Live Activity in your app.

The app mocks a grocery delivery order that can be tracked through a Live Activity. 
The activity displays the number of items ordered by the customer, the current step in the delivery process and the ETA of the delivery.
